# Heart-Failure-Prediction-Using-ML
This will be an interactive webpage in which a user can enter various specific information from either drop-down menus or fill-in boxes, which will then be interpreted through a trained model. This model will predict the probability of the user having heart disease/failure based on a variety of data it has been given and trained with.
